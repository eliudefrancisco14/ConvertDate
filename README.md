# Handling Date and Time Data Types in C#

This is a simple C# project that addresses handling of date and time data types, as well as conversions between them. Here are some of the key topics covered in this project:

## Converting Date to String

We demonstrate how to convert a date object to a readable string representation.

## Getting Todayâ€™s Date and Time

We show how to obtain the current date and time using the features offered by the C# language.

## Extracting Day, Month, and Year from Date

We explore methods for extracting individual components such as day, month, and year from a date object.

## About the TimeSpan Data Type

We introduce the TimeSpan data type and how it can be used to represent time intervals.

This project serves as an introductory guide to handling date and time data in C#, along with providing insights into common operations performed with these data types.
